# Student Grades Manager (Console-Based)

## 📌 Project Overview
Student Grades Manager is a **console-based Java application** that records student names and grades, stores them in an **ArrayList**, and generates a summary report.  
It calculates the **average, highest, and lowest scores**, showcasing Java concepts like classes, objects, loops, and basic statistics.

## ✨ Features
- Input student names and grades  
- Store data using **ArrayList**  
- Calculate and display:  
  - Average grade  
  - Highest grade (with student name)  
  - Lowest grade (with student name)  
- Generate a **summary report**
